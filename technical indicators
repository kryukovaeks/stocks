Let's delve deeper into these technical indicators:

1. **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)**:
   - MACD is a momentum-based indicator used to spot changes in the strength, direction, momentum, and duration of a trend in a stock's price.
   - The MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) from the 12-period EMA. This result is the MACD line.
   - A signal line, which is a 9-day EMA of the MACD, is plotted alongside the MACD to signal when to buy or sell.
   - **Signals**:
     - **Crossover**: A buy signal is given when the MACD line crosses above the Signal line and vice-versa.
     - **Divergence**: If the stock price diverges from the MACD, it signals the end of the current trend.
     - **Dramatic Rise or Fall**: If the MACD rises or falls rapidly, it indicates overbought or oversold conditions.

2. **RSI (Relative Strength Index)**:
   - The RSI is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. The RSI oscillates between zero and 100 and is typically used to identify overbought or oversold conditions in a traded security.
   - **Formula**: \( RSI = 100 - \frac{100}{1 + RS} \) where \( RS \) is the average of x days' up closes divided by the average of x days' down closes.
   - **Signals**:
     - Values above 70 are generally considered overbought.
     - Values below 30 are considered oversold.
     - Divergences between RSI and stock price can indicate an upcoming trend reversal.

3. **Bollinger Bands**:
   - Bollinger Bands consist of a middle band being an N-period simple moving average (SMA), an upper band at K times an N-period standard deviation above the middle band, and a lower band at K times an N-period standard deviation below the middle band.
   - **Formula**:
     - Middle Band = 20-day simple moving average (SMA)
     - Upper Band = 20-day SMA + (20-day standard deviation of price x 2)
     - Lower Band = 20-day SMA - (20-day standard deviation of price x 2)
   - **Signals**:
     - **Squeezes**: A squeeze denotes a period of low volatility and is considered by traders to be a potential indicator of future increased volatility and possible trading opportunities.
     - **Bollinger Bounce**: Prices tend to bounce between the upper and lower Bollinger bands.
     - **Bollinger Bulge**: Indicates a surge in price volatility.
     - Price moving outside the bands is a continuation signal and not reversal signalsâ€”contrary to what some traders believe.

When using these indicators:
- Remember that technical indicators should not be used in isolation. Combining various indicators can provide more reliable signals.
- Always be aware of the underlying fundamentals of the asset you're trading.
- Finally, past behavior of these indicators doesn't guarantee future results. Ensure you combine technical analysis with risk management strategies.
